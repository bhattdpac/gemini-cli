Debugging is a key part of contributing.

  Now, let's focus on the SettingsDialog.test.tsx file, as it has multiple timeout failures.

   1. Open the file in VS Code:
      src/ui/components/SettingsDialog.test.tsx

   2. Examine the failing tests: Look for the it blocks that correspond to these test names:
       * SettingsDialog > Scope Selection > should switch between scopes
       * SettingsDialog > Restart Prompt > should handle restart request when r is pressed
       * SettingsDialog > Escape Key Behavior > should call onSelect with undefined when Escape is pressed
       * SettingsDialog > Complex State Management > should track modified settings correctly
       * SettingsDialog > Complex State Management > should handle scrolling when there are many settings

      Pay close attention to what these tests are trying to do and how they interact with the SettingsDialog component. Timeouts often occur
  when a test is waiting for a UI element to appear or an event to fire, but it never happens, or it takes too long.

   3. Debugging with VS Code (as per `CONTRIBUTING.md`):
       * You can try to run the tests in debug mode. The CONTRIBUTING.md mentions:
   1         npm run debug
          This command runs node --inspect-brk dist/gemini.js and pauses execution until a debugger attaches. You can then use VS Code's
  "Attach" launch configuration (found in .vscode/launch.json) to connect to the debugger. You can set breakpoints in your test file or the
  component's source code.

  Start by examining the code for these failing tests.
